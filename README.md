# New York Taxi 2016 Analysis

To prepare analysis for New York Taxis, I have been using public data set from BigQuery (bigquery-public-data.new_york.tlc_yellow_trips_2016).

Analysis consisted of the following steps:
1. Descriptive analysis of categorical data (vendors, passenger count, rate codes, payment types, store and forward trips)
2. Total numbers for numerical data (records count, passenger count, trip distances, trip time, total amount, trip tips)
3. Exploratory analysis to answer questions:
    * 'How does number of trips, average trip time, average trip cost and average trip distance changes over time of the day?'
    * 'How does average trip price per minute and per mile changes over time of the day? When is it more profitable to have shorter rides?'
    * 'Does this statistic differ for each weekday, is it different on weekends?'
    * 'How does statistic changes throughout a year by month?'
    * 'How does daily statistic changes throughout a year?'
    * 'Does public holidays and other special days affect NY taxis?'
